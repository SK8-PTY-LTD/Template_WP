== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. How do I add the slider to my site? =
You can add your slider by shortcode or via the widget control panel or PHP shortcode.

= 2. Where can I reach the documentation? =
[http://doc.smartslider3.com](http://doc.smartslider3.com)

= 3. What should I do when I see blank area where the slider should show or the slider doesn't work? =
It means that there is a JavaScript error on your site which blocks other scripts(for example Smart Slider's scripts). You can open up the browser debugger window with F12 button and check the console if it shows error or not. If you solve these errors Smart Slider should work fine.

Usual problem is that you have the latest WordPress version, but your theme loads very old jQuery version (1.7 or older) and the WordPress admin bar throws a JavaScript error. In this case, you have to remove the old jQuery from your theme's functions.php.

If you are unable to solve these problems, feel free to [contact us!](http://smartslider3.com/contact-us/)
