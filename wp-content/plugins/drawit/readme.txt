Draw and edit flow charts, diagrams, images and more while editing a post.

== Description ==

DrawIt is a WordPress plugin that interfaces with the draw.io website to easily create beautiful diagrams, flow charts and drawings inline while you are editing a post. This powerful plugin saves the draw.io source code for your diagram and a PNG or SVG version of the image â€“ providing crisp images that you can update without redrawing the diagram. There is also no hassle moving images back and forth between editors on your computer like typically is done without this plugin.

There are multiple ways to add a diagram, use whichever is most convenient for you: through the Media Library, the visual editor or the text editor.

This plugin connects directly to the draw.io website, which is a high-quality diagram and flow chart tool with a feature set on par with other well-known diagram editors (like Microsoft Visio), so the interface will already be intuitive. Best of all, it is **free!**

== Installation ==

1. Go to WP admin > Plugins > Add New
1. Search for "DrawIt" in the search field, press Enter.
1. Click "Install Now"
1. Click "Activate Plugin"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I edit a diagram? =

To edit a diagram that you've already created, just select it (e.g., the source code in the text post editor or the image itself in the visual post editor) and then click on the DrawIt button in the editor!

= How do I report a bug or feature request? =

Please report all bugs and feature requests through the [DrawIt support page on WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/drawit) or through the [Google+ DrawIt community](https://plus.google.com/communities/112051242587930767153).

= Where is the source code for my diagram saved? =

The source code for the diagram is saved with the image in your WordPress installation. As long as you do not delete the image from your media library, then you will be able to open and edit the image from the post/page editor where it is being used.

= How do I edit a diagram that is only in the media library and not inserted into a post? =

For now, you'll have to insert it into a post to be able to edit it. We'll work on improving this later.
