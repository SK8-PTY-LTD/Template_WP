= 2. What is the difference between galleries and albums? =
The galleries are designed to contain images, whereas albums contain either galleries and/or other albums. 

= 3. Can I add images using FTP? =
Unfortunately, there is no such option. During the upload the thumbnails of the images are being created, whereas when using FTP the thumbnails do not get generated.  The image thumbnails are required for most of the views. Thus using Media Upload is the only option.

It is only possible to translate the front end of the plugin. To do so, you should set define('WPLANG','[lang_code]') to the desired language code in wp_config.php file of your website. This way the plugin should be translated automatically. Please be informed, that you can modify the translations from wp-content/plugins/photo_gallery/languages/ (you will need POEdit http://www.poedit.net/download.php).
