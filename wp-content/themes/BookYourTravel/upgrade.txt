3. Turn on maintenance on your website. You can use a plugin like this one for the purpose: https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-maintenance-mode/
4. Backup your languages folder inside wp-content/themes/BookYourTravel
5. Delete all files and folders inside wp-content/themes/BookYourTravel parent folder except the languages folder if you have translations there.
6. Upload contents of the above mentioned unzipped BookYourTravel.zip file to wp-content/themes/BookYourTravel.
NOTE: While uploading your code, do not access your wordpress admin. Let the upload finish first.
7. Clear your browser cache!
8. Readd the contents of your languages folder into wp-content/themes/BookYourTravel/languages

If using a child theme:

9. Backup your child theme.
10. Upgrade each php and js file in your child theme to latest version. 
11. Re-add your code changes to the php and js files by using a text editor.
12. If you are upgrading from version 6 to version 7 you have to go to Appearance -> Widgets and readd your widgets to your sidebars. We had to rename
our theme's custom widget classes due to ThemeForest submission requirements and this causes the widgets to be removed from your sidebars.
13. If you are upgrading from version 6 to version 7 go to Theme options and click Save at the bottom.

And finally

14. Turn off maintenance mode.
15. Test your theme and website.
