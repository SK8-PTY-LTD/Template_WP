			"post_content": "Listify offers a simple way to connect with potential customers in your neighborhood, allowing you to take a step back from marketing your business so you can focus on your service or products. Elegant, simple and easy to use, Listify offers a way to generate revenue without the headaches.\n\n<h3 class='ion-person-add'>1. Create an Account</h3>\n<img class='alignright size-full' src='http://f6ca679df901af69ace6-d3d26a34307edc4f7eeb40d85a64c4a7.r91.cf5.rackcdn.com/listify-xml-images/page-how-it-works-1.png' width='180px' />Creating an account with Listify is easy, with the social login feature it allows your visitors to login easily, so that they won’t have the “login/register” friction. They’ll be creating, rating and favoriting listings in no time!\n\nWe’ve even integrated with WooCommerce so that the <a href='http://astoundify.com/go/woocommerce-social-login'>Social Login by WooCommerce plugin</a> (Plugin sold separately) and the standard WooCommerce sign up process is fully supported.\n\n<h3 class='ion-compose'>2. Submit Your Listing</h3>\n<img class='alignleft size-full' src='http://f6ca679df901af69ace6-d3d26a34307edc4f7eeb40d85a64c4a7.r91.cf5.rackcdn.com/listify-xml-images/page-how-it-works-2.png' width='220px' />\nSubmitting a listing using Listify is super simple, we&#8217;ve made entering the address of your place easy, when using our <a href='https://astoundify.com/downloads/wp-job-manager-extended-location/'>Google Places API plugin</a> (Plugin sold separately) it will auto complete the listing address.\n\nYou can even fully customize your submission form either using PHP code using this <a href='https://wpjobmanager.com/document/editing-job-submission-fields/'>tutorial</a> or by installing the <a href='https://plugins.smyl.es/wp-job-manager-field-editor/'>Form Editor plugin</a> (Plugin sold separately) this gives you full control over the display of the fields that are shown on your submission form.\n\n<h3 class='ion-bag'>3. Get More Interest In Your Place</h3><img class='alignright size-full' src='http://f6ca679df901af69ace6-d3d26a34307edc4f7eeb40d85a64c4a7.r91.cf5.rackcdn.com/listify-xml-images/page-how-it-works-3.png' width='220px' />\n\nThis won’t be the first time you look for a listing directory theme, but it may be the last time. Because with Listify you have more than you could ever want or need.\n\nWhen using Listify your site will be a thing of beauty. Let’s be honest. The problem with most listing directories, while highly functional, is that many of them aren’t very pretty. It’s why the beautiful ones are so popular, because they match great photography with fantastic functionality.\n\nThat’s what we’ve done with Listify.\n\n<p style='text-align: center;'><a href='#' class='button'>Get Started Now</a></p>",
